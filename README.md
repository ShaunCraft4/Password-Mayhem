# Password-Mayhem
Please note that for the code to run properly, you have to download everything and store the entire thing in a file like how I uploaded it here so that everything is in the same directory.

Then just open the "Password Mayhem.py" file with your Python interpreter (Would heavily and I mean HEAVILY suggest using VSCode for this) to use it!

Please note that you might need to install a few modules for the code to work. For this purpose please use the pip install command in the python console.

Also in case you are not aware, to go to the website, after running the code you will receive a link in the python console. Simply either ctrl+click the link or copy and paste it into your browser.
